# D&Dice Roller

This project is a dice roller made specifically for Dungeons & Dragons. When playing D&D there are a large amount of different dice needed when rolling for spells, to attack, or for damage. 

This dice roller helps the user limit the amount of dice needed and helps save time when they need to roll damage for a fireball.

The project is made with an Arduino Uno, and uses a 4x4 keypad as an input while using a LCD screen and speaker as an output.
